# Pothole Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model for detecting potholes in images of roads. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images as either containing potholes or not.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pothole-detection.git
    cd pothole-detection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the trained model for pothole detection:
1. Place your test images in the `test_images` directory.
2. Run the prediction script:
    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```
The results will be saved in the `results` directory.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of road images labeled as either containing potholes or not. It is split into two categories:
- **Normal roads**: 352 images
- **Roads with potholes**: 329 images

The images are resized to 100x100 pixels for consistency during training.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture is as follows:
- Input layer: 100x100x3 (RGB images)
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- Max pooling layers
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Fully connected layers
- Output layer with softmax activation for binary classification

## Training

To train the model:
1. Ensure your dataset is properly organized in the `dataset` directory.
2. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

The trained model will be saved as `pothole_detection_model.h5`.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

To evaluate the model on the test set:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## Results

The current model achieves the following performance on the test set:
- **Accuracy**: 92%
- **Precision**: 90%
- **Recall**: 94%
- **F1-score**: 92%

## Future Improvements

- Collect and incorporate a larger, more diverse dataset
- Experiment with different CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)
- Implement data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization
- Develop a real-time pothole detection system for video streams
- Create a user-friendly interface for easy use by non-technical users
